# PROJECT CHARTER
# Invisible Friction: Understanding Excessive Hesitation in E-commerce Decisions
## 1. Domain
### E-commerce digital product analysis:
This project focuses on user behavior in online shopping environments, specifically during high stakes purchase decisions involving multiple options, prices, and information cues.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional e-commerce analytics focuses on conversion rates and funnel drop-offs, but these metrics fail to explain why users abandon after showing strong purchase intent.

This project investigates a more subtle and costly problem:
` Excessive user hesitation leading to abandonment after deep engagement. `

These users are not casual browsers... they invest time, compare options, interact with product details, and still fail to commit.


## 3. Definition of Failure
A failed decision is defined as:
` A user abandoning the purchase after demonstrating deep engagement and prolonged hesitation. `

Operationally, this includes:

- Extended time spent evaluating a product or cart

- Multiple option changes or backtracking actions

- No purchase completion within the same decision window

This definition intentionally excludes:

- Quick bounces

- Casual browsing

- Price only rejections

## Why Existing Dashboards Fall Short
Most dashboards answer:

- “Where did users drop off?”

- “What is the conversion rate?”

They do not answer:

- Why did committed users hesitate?

- What signals indicate cognitive overload?

- Which behaviors predict abandonment before it happens?

As a result, organizations optimize for more traffic, not better decisions

## 6. Analytical Approach
This project reframes e-commerce analytics from outcome tracking to decision quality analysis by:

- Modeling hesitation as a time-based behavioral process

- Capturing micro-interactions (option changes, backtracking, help usage)

- Introducing a novel Cognitive Load Score to quantify decision difficulty

- Identifying behavioral patterns that precede abandonment

The goal is not just to observe behavior, but to diagnose friction.

## 7. Hypothesis
High cognitive load, driven by excessive options, prolonged evaluation time, and repeated reversals, increases abandonment even among highly engaged users. 

A secondary hypothesis:
`Some abandonment events are not caused by lack of intent, but by decision fatigue and overload.`

## 8. Expected Business Value
If validated, this analysis can help organizations:

- Detect abandonment risk earlier in the decision journey

- Reduce friction without increasing discounts

- Improve UX by simplifying choice architecture

- Shift optimization from “more clicks” to “better decisions”

## 9. Ethical Considerations

This project avoids manipulative design practices and focuses on:

- Reducing unnecessary cognitive burden

- Improving clarity and confidence

- Informed user decisions
