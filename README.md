## Invisible Friction in E-Commerce (Power BI Project)

I rebuilt an end-to-end analytics project analyzing “invisible friction” in e-commerce decisions.

Using Python, I generated a richer decision- and event-level dataset, engineered behavioral features (hesitation, engagement, cognitive load), and created a 3-page Power BI dashboard to surface how cognitive friction relates to abandonment.

**Key takeaways:**
- Higher cognitive load is associated with higher abandonment  
- Abandoned users tend to hesitate longer before exiting  
- Specific high-risk decision moments can be identified and prioritized for UX improvement
