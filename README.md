#  Invisible Friction: Decision Analytics in E-commerce
By focusing on decision quality and cognitive friction instead of traditional conversion metrics, this project examines the reasons why highly engaged users give up on online purchases.

This analysis models each purchase attempt as a decision moment, a time-based sequence of micro-behaviors like option changes, backtracking, hesitation duration, and confusion signals, instead of treating abandonment as a straightforward funnel drop-off.

In order to measure decision difficulty and spot patterns of excessive hesitation that precede abandonment, even among users with strong purchase intent, the project presents a novel Cognitive Load Score.

This project seeks to identify invisible friction in digital shopping experiences and show how improved decision design, rather than just increased traffic, can lead to better results by combining behavioral event modeling, synthetic decision data, and exploratory analytics.
